1.  D&P system - enable by default is fine for new content types however there
    needs to be option right in the creation of content-type to enable/disable
    that before user has even saved it. It makes no sense for some content-types
    to have draft system (Comments, Tags, Categories etc)
2.  D&P - returning all
    data on REST and GQL even if not published and not authenticated
3.  Content
    editor information box - great new feature, but it should contain created at,
    status (draft, published) as well as published date. Also think button to
    delete the entry should be here.
4.  buttons at top of content editor page
    should have save as draft or save and publish if status is draft. if its
    already published only show save button and in information box add ability to
    then unpublish
